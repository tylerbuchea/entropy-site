        This was a project I worked on with another Portland agency
        for a high profile client. It is a racing game that involves
        drones and was used as part of a training program for partnered
        businesses to learn more about the client and their offerings.

        This project was created right before web browsers
        were upgraded with some very specific technologies that
        would allow good performance on mobile browsers. The initial
        version of this game experience didn't have mobile support
        we have since created a new mobile friendly build and uploaded
        for you here:

        Working on this project I learned about browser support
        for mobile gaming and realized we were right on the cusp.
        The very idea for Tensor's specific offering of mobile first
        web experience was born out of the realizations brought to light
        by this project.

        This was less of a game and more of an experimental experience.
        This project was also for trainging purposes, but instead of presenting
        business partners with a boring list we distributed the contents of data
        in 3D space and allowed the viewers to pan around and explore the content
        via floating geometries we dubbed "geods".

        This project was initially setup to run on a very specific
        resolution large touch screen. This was ideal since the deployment
        was contained to physical events and we had access to the devices it ran on.
        We have since uploaded a new version that is better suited to be tested
        on all devices (including mobile). You can check that out here:

        This is a proof of concept turned into a fully realized game. Tensor took
        everything we learned from passed projects about making mobile games performant, playable,
        and fun on the web and poored that expertise into this game.

        Ever since the death of Adobe Flash web based games have also died.
        But there is new technology that has recently been implemented by every major browser!
        Not only is this new technology a replacement for flash based games.
        It is far better and Star Master can prove it!
