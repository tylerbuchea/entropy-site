# Work to be done

- Play with different color schems (blues, purples, etc) ?
- Add Medium style image "blur up" on load
- Add revert to toolbar when modal is scrolled past header
- Explore alternate curves for animations (bazier, etc, etc)
- ~~Add SVG "x" to replace modal close~~
- ~~Scoll to top of modal on active~~
- ~~Add momentum scrolling~~
- ~~Add dark opaque gradient to top and bottom of header images so text and "x" are visible~~
